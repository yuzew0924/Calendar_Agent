# Calendar Agent

Calendar Agent is a course schedule planning assistant that helps students compare possible class schedules before registration. Users can enter courses, available lecture and quiz sections, fixed choices, and scheduling preferences. The app then generates ranked schedule options and displays each one as a weekly calendar.

## Description

Planning a course schedule is often messy because every course may have several lectures, quiz sections, labs, availability states, and registration constraints. Calendar Agent is designed to turn that information into clear options.

The project focuses on three core problems:

- Finding conflict-free combinations across multiple courses.
- Ranking schedules based on personal preferences.
- Showing each result visually so the user can quickly judge whether the schedule feels too tight, too spread out, or acceptable.

The planned architecture uses a React frontend for the interactive calendar interface and a Python backend for schedule generation, scoring, and future AI-assisted input parsing.

## Features

- Enter courses with lectures, quiz sections, labs, and meeting times.
- Mark sections as fixed when the user has already chosen them.
- Filter by availability, such as open-only sections.
- Detect time conflicts across weekdays.
- Apply preferences such as avoiding early classes or avoiding awkward gaps.
- Generate multiple ranked schedule plans.
- Explain why each schedule is recommended or penalized.
- Return deterministic Top N recommendations through a single API.
- Visualize each schedule as a weekly calendar.
- Compare alternate course sets, such as `208 + 414 + 370 + 332` versus `351 + 414 + 370 + 332`.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- Scheduling Engine: Python service layer
- Testing: pytest for backend tests, Vitest for frontend tests
- AI Layer: validated preference parsing and grounded reason rewriting; OCR remains future work

## Requirements

Planned development requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+
- npm or pnpm
- pip
- Git

No external API key is required for the initial manual-input MVP. Future screenshot parsing or AI extraction features may require an API key.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd calendar-agent
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd ../backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The backend uses FastAPI and Uvicorn.

## Usage

Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default.

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open the local app:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Example workflow:

1. Add courses such as `MATH 208`, `CSE 414`, `INFO 370`, and `CSE 332`.
2. Enter each available lecture and quiz section.
3. Lock fixed sections, such as `CSE 414 C` and `CSE 414 CD`.
4. Set preferences, such as no classes before `9:30 AM` unless unavoidable.
5. Generate schedule options.
6. Compare the ranked results in the weekly calendar view.

The implemented frontend presents this as a three-stage guided workflow:
**Course data**, **Confirm preferences**, and **Schedule options**. Users add
courses through a structured form with repeatable lecture, quiz, and lab rows;
the frontend converts those rows into the backend course schema internally. It
summarizes the resulting section groups, calls the AI preference parser, lets
the user confirm the validated interpretation, and then calls the ranked
schedule API. Candidate schedules can be switched directly in the results view,
with a weekly calendar, score, reasons, trade-offs, and score breakdown for each
option. See
[`docs/frontend-workflow.md`](docs/frontend-workflow.md) for the complete UI flow
and course-input behavior.

AI interpretation is always shown before generation. Users can return to edit
the original preference text, and unresolved hard conflicts disable schedule
generation. Validation, AI, connectivity, and no-result states provide specific
recovery information instead of a generic failure message.

For a no-setup demonstration, select **Load sample data**. The bundled courses
render a structural summary and contain at least one conflict-free combination.
Preference text accepts English or Chinese. Blank preference text is handled as
an explicit default of open sections only, with no additional ranking
preferences.

## Example Input

```json
{
  "courses": [
    {
      "code": "CSE 373",
      "title": "Data Structures and Algorithms",
      "groups": [
        {
          "type": "lecture",
          "choose": 1,
          "sections": [
            {
              "id": "A",
              "status": "open",
              "sln": "12301",
              "meetings": [
                {
                  "days": ["M", "W", "F"],
                  "startTime": "09:30",
                  "endTime": "10:20",
                  "location": "KNE 120"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "preferences": {
    "earliestStart": "09:30",
    "allowEarlierIfOnlyOption": true,
    "allowedGapMinutes": 90,
    "minimumLongGapMinutes": 120,
    "requireOpenSections": true,
    "fixedSections": {
      "CSE 373": ["A"]
    }
  }
}
```

This payload maps directly to `ScheduleRequest`. The canonical field
definitions, defaults, validation rules, object relationships, and response
example are documented in [`docs/input-format.md`](docs/input-format.md).
The complete development fixture includes lecture-only, lecture+lab, and
lecture+quiz+lab courses in
[`sample-data/courses.json`](sample-data/courses.json).

### Request Rules

- `courses` is required and must contain at least one course. `code` values
  must be unique within the request.
- JSON uses `camelCase`. Unknown fields are rejected by the backend models.
- `days` only accepts `M`, `T`, `W`, `Th`, and `F`.
- `startTime`, `endTime`, and `earliestStart` use strict 24-hour `HH:MM`, such
  as `09:30`. Every meeting must satisfy `startTime < endTime`.
- A section group's `choose` value is optional, defaults to `1`, and cannot use
  any other value. An empty declared group produces zero schedules.
- Course components are defined only by `groups`. A missing quiz or lab group is
  not inferred or added by the backend.
- `fixedSections` maps an existing course `code` to existing section IDs in that
  course. When `requireOpenSections` is `true`, every fixed section must also be
  `open`.
- `allowedGapMinutes` and `minimumLongGapMinutes` must be non-negative when set.

The source of truth is
[`backend/app/models.py`](backend/app/models.py), with the full field table in
[`docs/input-format.md`](docs/input-format.md).

### AI Preference Output

Natural-language preferences never enter the scheduler directly. An AI parser
must first return JSON that validates as `ParsedPreferences`:

```json
{
  "earliestStart": "10:00",
  "earliestStartIsHard": true,
  "preferredDaysOff": ["F"],
  "requiredDaysOff": [],
  "preferredTimeOfDay": "afternoon",
  "gapPreference": "compact",
  "fixedSections": ["CSE 373 A"],
  "requireOpenSections": true,
  "hardConstraints": ["Do not start before 10:00"],
  "softPreferences": ["Prefer compact schedules"],
  "conflicts": [],
  "needsClarification": false,
  "clarificationQuestions": []
}
```

The AI integration uses strict Structured Outputs and requests every field in
this fixed schema. It may not return Markdown, explanatory text, extra fields,
or course and section references absent from the supplied catalog. Vague
preferences remain soft; contradictions are reported through `conflicts` and
`clarificationQuestions` instead of being invented as scheduler constraints.
The backend parses the JSON through Pydantic before any conversion.

Before scheduler conversion, the backend builds a section index from the
validated request courses. A reference such as `CSE 373 A` must match both an
existing `CSE 373` course and section `A` owned by that course. Valid references
are converted to the scheduler format `{"CSE 373": ["A"]}`; invented references
are rejected and never reach the solver.

Ambiguous language is not promoted into a hard filter. For example, "not too
early" remains a soft preference with `earliestStart: null`, while "classes
must not start before 10:00" may set a hard `10:00` boundary. When a mandatory
meaning cannot be represented safely, the parser returns
`needsClarification: true` with a focused clarification question.

The backend independently checks obvious hard conflicts after parsing. It
rejects fixed sections that meet on a required day off, start before a hard
`earliestStart`, or select multiple alternatives from the same section group.
AI-reported conflicts are also blocking. These cases return an
`ai_preference_conflict` error and do not enter schedule generation.

AI failures are fail-closed. Timeout, authentication, rate-limit, network,
provider, empty-output, malformed-JSON, Markdown-wrapped JSON, and schema
validation failures return explicit API errors. The backend does not substitute
default preferences or generate a schedule after a parsing failure.

`to_scheduler_preferences()` converts recognized structured fields into the
Week 2/3 `Preferences` model. Fixed sections and open-only are hard scheduler
filters. A hard earliest start maps to the engine's earliest-start fields.
Preferred days off and free-text preference arrays are retained for future
ranking or explanation and are not executed as filtering rules.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "schedules": [],
  "count": 0,
  "warnings": []
}
```

## Parse Preferences API

`POST /parse-preferences` converts natural-language scheduling preferences into
validated, course-grounded `ParsedPreferences`. The request must include the
real course catalog because fixed sections are checked against it.

```json
{
  "courses": [
    {
      "code": "CSE 373",
      "title": "Data Structures and Algorithms",
      "groups": [
        {
          "type": "lecture",
          "choose": 1,
          "sections": [
            {
              "id": "A",
              "status": "open",
              "meetings": [
                {
                  "days": ["M", "W", "F"],
                  "startTime": "10:30",
                  "endTime": "11:20"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "preferenceText": "Avoid early classes, prefer Friday off, and require CSE 373 A."
}
```

The response is the `ParsedPreferences` schema shown above. The endpoint never
returns raw model output. Pydantic validation, course/section grounding, and
hard-conflict checks complete before a response is returned. It does not invoke
schedule generation; callers explicitly pass converted preferences to the
scheduler in a later step.

Run all backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

Run only AI parser and endpoint tests:

```bash
pytest tests/ai
```

## Generate Schedules API

`POST /api/schedules/generate` connects validated preferences, the conflict-free
scheduler, deterministic scoring, Top N ranking, and grounded explanations.
Send exactly one of `preferenceText` or a previously parsed `preferences`
object. `topN` defaults to `5`; `enhanceReasons` defaults to `true`.

```json
{
  "courses": [
    {
      "code": "CSE 373",
      "title": "Data Structures and Algorithms",
      "groups": [
        {
          "type": "lecture",
          "choose": 1,
          "sections": [
            {
              "id": "A",
              "status": "open",
              "meetings": [
                {
                  "days": ["M", "W", "F"],
                  "startTime": "10:30",
                  "endTime": "11:20"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "preferenceText": "Prefer afternoon classes and require CSE 373 A.",
  "topN": 5,
  "enhanceReasons": true
}
```

Every returned schedule has `rank`, `score`, `sections`, `scoreBreakdown`,
`reasons`, and `tradeoffs`. Ranking is fully deterministic; AI never assigns a
score or rank. AI may only rewrite existing explanations, and an invalid or
unavailable rewrite falls back to deterministic text without failing schedule
generation. See [`docs/ranking-and-api.md`](docs/ranking-and-api.md) for the
complete response and scoring contract.

Scoring is preference-driven. In particular, gap length and compactness affect
scores only when the user supplies `gapPreference: "compact"`, `"balanced"`, or
`"breaks"`. With `gapPreference: "none"`, all schedules receive the same neutral
gap contribution and gap shape does not affect ranking.

Each score-breakdown rule includes its score delta, matched preference,
calculation details, reason and trade-off candidates, and affected sections and
meetings. The API validates that the total score equals the sum of these rule
contributions. `topN` defaults to 5, and preference-aware deterministic
tie-breakers produce stable ranks for identical input.

When no legal schedule exists, the endpoint still returns HTTP 200 with the
same stable response shape and actionable warnings:

```json
{
  "interpretedPreferences": {
    "earliestStart": null,
    "earliestStartIsHard": false,
    "preferredDaysOff": [],
    "requiredDaysOff": [],
    "preferredTimeOfDay": "none",
    "gapPreference": "none",
    "fixedSections": [],
    "requireOpenSections": true,
    "hardConstraints": [],
    "softPreferences": [],
    "conflicts": [],
    "needsClarification": false,
    "clarificationQuestions": []
  },
  "schedules": [],
  "count": 0,
  "warnings": [
    "All remaining combinations have meeting conflicts or incompatible course-component requirements."
  ]
}
```

Directory responsibilities:

- `frontend/`: React, TypeScript, and Vite application for course input, preference controls, schedule results, and calendar visualization.
- `backend/`: Python backend for schedule generation, scoring, API routes, and future AI-assisted extraction.
- `backend/app/scheduler/`: Framework-independent time, combination, conflict,
  scoring, and explanation logic that can be tested without FastAPI.
- `sample-data/`: Example course and preference payloads used for development and testing.
- `docs/`: Product notes, agent design, and input-format documentation.
- `.env.example`: Template for local configuration values.

## Configuration

Create a local environment file from the provided example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The example contains:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
BACKEND_HOST=127.0.0.1
BACKEND_PORT=8000
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=
AI_PREFERENCE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=20
```

`VITE_API_BASE_URL` tells the React app where to reach FastAPI. Vite is configured
to load `.env` from the repository root. `BACKEND_HOST` and `BACKEND_PORT` define
the intended local backend bind address. Keep secrets in `.env`; Git ignores that
file, while `.env.example` documents safe placeholder values.

`OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL` are required only when an AI feature is
called. `AI_PREFERENCE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` defaults to `20` and must be greater
than zero. The key is read at runtime by the backend AI client and must never be
committed or sent to the frontend.

To run Uvicorn with the configured backend values:

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
set -a
source ../.env
set +a
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host "$BACKEND_HOST" --port "$BACKEND_PORT"
```

## Testing

Run backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

Run frontend tests:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```

Run the frontend tests continuously while editing:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:watch
```

The current frontend verification commands are:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Testing should cover:

- Time parsing.
- Conflict detection.
- Gap calculation.
- Fixed-section handling.
- Schedule ranking.
- API request and response validation.
- Calendar rendering behavior.

## Week 2 — Course Schema & Validation

**Dates:** 2026-08-17 to 2026-08-23

**Goal:** Accurately represent different course structures through explicit
section groups and reject invalid course data at the request boundary.

### Completion Standard

Week 2 is complete when all of the following remain true:

- `Meeting`, `Section`, `SectionGroup`, `Course`, `Preferences`,
  `ParsedPreferences`, and `ScheduleRequest` are implemented as
  Pydantic models.
- The README request and response JSON examples parse through those models.
- `sample-data/courses.json` contains lecture-only, lecture+lab, and
  lecture+quiz+lab examples with open and closed sections.
- Parsing a course preserves exactly its input groups and never adds absent
  components.
- Invalid weekdays, time formats, time ranges, group selection counts, and fixed
  sections produce validation errors.
- Running `cd backend && pytest` passes the complete backend test suite.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Course data must initially be entered manually.
- Screenshot parsing is planned but not implemented yet.
- Seat availability refresh is planned but not implemented yet.
- The first version will focus on weekday schedules.

## Roadmap

- Build the React course input and preference UI.
- Add weekly calendar visualization.
- Add sample course data.
- Add import support for pasted registration tables.
- Add screenshot/OCR-assisted extraction.
- Add export to `.ics` calendar files.
- Add saved schedule scenarios.
