# Frontend Workflow

The frontend provides one guided path from course availability to ranked schedule
options. Users do not need to call backend endpoints manually.

## Main Flow

1. Enter a course name and add each possible lecture, quiz, or lab section row,
   or select **Load sample data** for an immediate example.
2. Add the course and review the course count and generated section groups.
3. Enter schedule preferences in natural language.
4. Send the preferences to `POST /parse-preferences`.
5. Review the validated hard constraints, soft preferences, conflicts, and any
   clarification questions returned by the backend.
6. Confirm the interpretation or return to edit the preference text.
7. Send the confirmed request to `POST /api/schedules/generate`.
8. Review the ranked, conflict-free schedule candidates.
9. Switch between candidates and compare their weekly calendars.
10. Inspect each option's score, reasons, trade-offs, and score breakdown.

## Confirmation and Revision

The interpretation screen separates hard constraints from soft preferences and
shows clarification questions and hard conflicts without reducing them to a
generic warning. **Confirm and generate** is disabled while either condition is
unresolved. **Revise preferences** returns to the input screen with the original
`preferenceText` intact, so the user can edit it and run parsing again.

## Application States

The UI provides feedback for initial input, preference parsing, schedule
generation, successful results, course-form errors, FastAPI validation errors, AI
parsing failures, backend unavailability, and empty schedule results. An empty
result renders every backend diagnostic and a route back to edit the input.

No-result diagnostics distinguish an empty declared group, open-only section
exhaustion, overlapping fixed sections, hard time/day filters, and conflicts
among all remaining combinations.

## Course Input Rules

The course builder accepts a course code and repeatable section rows. Each row
contains a component type, section ID, weekday codes, start time, and end time.
All entered sections are treated as available (`open`). The frontend groups rows
by component type and sends the resulting schema to the backend; users never
need to write JSON.

- A lecture-only course is valid.
- Quiz and lab groups are created only when the user adds those row types.
- The frontend never invents a missing component.
- Section IDs must be unique within a course and use uppercase letters or
  numbers beginning with a letter.
- Weekdays use `M`, `T`, `W`, `Th`, and `F`; compact values such as `MWF` work.
- Start time must be earlier than end time.
- Invalid rows are shown as form errors before an API request is made.

The backend still supports and validates empty declared groups when requests are
sent directly through the API. The Pydantic models remain the authority for
complete schema validation.

## Preference Input

The preference editor accepts natural-language English and Chinese text. A
nonblank value is sent to `POST /parse-preferences` with the parsed courses. If
the field is blank, the frontend skips the AI call and presents explicit safe
defaults for confirmation: open sections only, with no additional hard or soft
preferences. This keeps the workflow usable without inventing user intent.
